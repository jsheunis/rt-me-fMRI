## Overview
This repository contains descriptions, code and data related to the real-time multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-me-fMRI) project conducted at the [Electrical Engineering department](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/) of the Eindhoven University of Technology. Project outputs include: 


1. A dataset and related publication:

    [**rt-me-fMRI: A task and resting state dataset for real-time, multi-echo fMRI methods development and validation**]()

2. A methods publication:

    [**Evaluating multi-echo fMRI combination and <i>T<sub>2</sub>\*</i>-mapping for offline and real-time BOLD sensitivity**]()
